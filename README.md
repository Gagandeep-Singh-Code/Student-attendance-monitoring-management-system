# Student attendance monitoring management system

There is a limited amount of time in which the teaching faculty in a classroom not only has to make sure that the concepts are comprehensible but rather than having the content at the focal point they have to focus on various aspects such as taking attendance, being attentive for every student and trying to deliver the content with sincerity. This puts off the balance leading to deterioration in learning, and wastage of valuable time and effort. Our project aims to make the lives of teachers easier by automatically marking students' attendance using Face recognition. It'll reduce the time wasted in taking attendance and also prevent proxy attendance. This project will also upload the attendance directly to a spreadsheet. It will not cause any disturbance during teaching and also save time. Although, it has some limitations on the distance from the students from which it can work, the use of high quality cameras and multiple cameras can reduce it. The project is quite realistic and efficient.
